#first 5 minutes the market moved up, we took a bullish position starting 
# from the second candleâ€™s opening price. Conversely, 
# if the first 5-minute candle was negative, we took a bearish position at 
# the open of the second 5-minute candle. No positions were opened when the 
# first 5-minute candle was a doji (open = close). The stop loss was placed at 
# the low of the day (which was the low of the first 5-minute candle) for a long trade, 
# and at the high of the day (which was the high of the first 5-minute candle) for a short trade,

#stop-entry price is risk $R

#We set the profit target at 10x the $R
#if no profit then seel last candle


#size:
#take lower between :
#Accbalance * 0.01(1%) / $R
#4(4x leverage) * AccBalance / P(opeing price)
